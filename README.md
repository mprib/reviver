# About

Things that I would like to have in an interface for LLMs:

- the ability to use speech to text on the desktop along with easy linking/loading of local files
- the ability to quickly direct bots to websites to provide context for questions (low priority)
- maintain multiple bots along with histories of their prompts.
    - If I experiment with a tweak to a prompt, I want to be able to quickly restore to a previous version if that prompt doesn't seem to be working well
- maintain multiple contexts that I can curate
    - I want to be able to select one or more contexts to inject into a given conversation
 
- automated summaries of ongoing conversations with the ability to purge older messages and replace with high level summaries
- storage of all chat history for searching /modification/training in the future
- checks on speech-to-text that can autoformat (via dedicated bots) to maintain clarity of conversation even if my engagement is more conversational.
- interface for multiple models
- tracking of current active context length with presentation of approximate costs per message as conversation expands...
